# Restaurant Branches Bot
## In this project, we perform the following activiites

1. open browser
1. extract data spanning across multiple pages
1. close browser
1. consolidate the data into 1 single **DataTable** 
1. loop through each row and assign data to variables like **CurrentBranch**, **CurrentRestaurant**, **CurrentManager**, **CurrentPhoneNo**
1. merge duplicate rows
1. remove duplicate rows and add only the distinct merged rows to the **FinalRestaurantDT** 
1. write ouput data to excel

## Key takeaways:
1. consolidating DataTables
1. removing duplicate rows
1. usage of **remove duplicate rows** activity (*Note: due to some reason it didn't work as intended*)
